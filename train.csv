without MedStacks solution.
MedStack has allowed us to focus on our core business. The 
fact that we haven't needed to worry about hosting is a huge 
testament to the service quality that MedStack provides.
MedStack's service saved us a lot of time and money with 
their PHIPA compliance out of a box solution.
I point out how easily MedStack took care of the heavy lifting 
with the server side of things, and setting us up with the best 
HIPAA consultant I have ever talked with.
Stands up to enterprise security requirements and our 
smaller group practice customers. Highly recommended!

Cuenta con ms de 12 aos de experiencia en Work For Hire con 
clientes en Norteamrica, Europa, Asia y Amrica Latina creando 
comerciales de TV, paruetes grficos y experiencias digitales para 
marcas como Unilever, Coca Cola, Sony Music, Colgate y Diageo.
A finales de 2009 identifica una oportunidad de creacin de 
propiedades intelectuales propias basandonos en el bajo costo de 
produccin el y el ADN que tenemos en animacin digital. 
 En 2010 basado en el surgimiento de nuevas plataformas decidimos 
re-enfocar el esfuerzo hacia propiedades transmediales que 
combinan videojuegos y animacin.
 En Marzo de 2011 cerramos nuestra ronda a de VC cerramos 
nuestra ronda A de capitalizacin por $1.5M para construir nuestras 
capacidades como estudio de videojuegos (BRAINZ GAMES) y 
decisimos desarrollar propiedades transmediales originales. Content is turning transmedia: 
Borderless story worlds are arcing over various platforms in innovative 
ways, providing consumers with multiple entry points that encourage

37,"Ad Revenue Optimization
for Web Publishers  Problem
Display Advertising CTRs (click through rates) have been falling[1]
constantly and one of the primary reason behind it is banner blindness.
Current Players such as Ad Networks/Exchanges/SSPs help publishers 
improve the CTR/RPM primarily by making the ads more relevant 
(through user bucketing/targeting), improving the fill rates and finding 
the highest bidder for each impression (RTB).
But they have no direct control over the last mile of the road, which is 
the placement of ads on the publishers website.
[1] DoubleClick for Advertisers, a cross section of regions, January and December 2009, Published July 2010 Solution
Publishers can optimize their ad revenues by testing different ad 
placements, ad sizes and ad types, which improves the CTR (Click 
through rate) and RPM (Revenue per Thousand Impressions) for them.
Further, using constant optimization, they can easily fight the big evil 
called Banner Blindness. Why Now?
AdTech is growing. Display Advertising (display, mobile and video) is 
forecasted to grow from approximately $43 billion in 2012 to $90 billion 
in 2017[1].
AdTech investments have been able to do IPOs recently (Rubicon,
Rocketfuel, Marin). Outbrain, RadiumOne and more to file soon.
A/B Testing is a hot market (Optimizely, VWO) and no one is using it for 
Publishers, yet.
[1] Rubicon S-1 Filing (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595974/000119312514034389/d652651ds1.htm) Product
AdPushup uses advanced A/B Testing (a proprietary multi-arm bandit 
solution) to web publishers optimize ad revenues by using advanced a/b 
testing between different ad placements, ad sizes, ad colors and types 
(such as image vs text).
All this simply by using a simple visual editor and no programming 
knowledge.
After finding the best variation, It keeps a check on banner blindness to 
keep your placements optimized at all times and can help fight AdBlock. Case Study

+1 415 994 4274 Our mission is to provide the invisible security layer for every URL 
and IP address that connects devices, APIs, apps and websites - 
protecting business from cyberattacks via malicious links.
Our go-to-market strategy starts with in-app security focussing 
on team collaboration because it is a vertical that is currently 
going through exponential growth.
1 MORE PEOPLE ARE OPENING WEB LINKS 
INSIDE APPS INSTEAD OF MOBILE BROWSERS
Users have come to expect security from browsers. 
So they assume theyre safe when opening links inside apps.
Present Future
SAFARI IN-APP 
BROWSER
2 HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS REALLY IS 
BANK OF AMERICA?
Millions of people now browse the web inside apps like 
Slack, HipChat, LinkedIn, Facebook, Messenger, Twitter et al.
Present Future
SAFARI
NATIVE 
BROWSER
SLACK 
IN-APP 
BROWSER
No Padlock

3 In-app browsing doesnt have built-in security like native 
browsers; Safari and Chrome. 
Millions of apps built by SMEs have no easy reliable way to 
protect users from malicious and inappropriate web links. 
and
Businesses that use Team Collaboration apps to share sensitive 
information are most vulnerable because of an exponentially 
increased user base - and security hasnt had time to keep up. 
THE PROBLEM
4 WHY NOW FOR 
IN-APP SECURITY?
Thanks to DIY app making platforms app creation by SMEs is 
EXPLODING and will surpass that of Internet domain names in 2016
Time spent within mobile apps now EXCEEDS desktop web access
Source: comScore
2013 2014
TOTAL MINUTES PER MONTH IN THE US:
5 WHY NOW FOR 
TEAM COLLABORATION SECURITY?
Millions of staff who work for businesses like Bank of America, Uber, Capital 
One and Intuit open web links inside team collaboration apps every day - 
with no protection against malicious links & inappropriate content.
THEN NOW
Users open web links 
using a desktop browser
Users open web links 
inside mobile apps
6
In the last two years, 21% of mobile web traffic came from in-app browsers It takes a Channel Partner 60mins 
to integrate the Security API. 
It takes 30 seconds for an SME to 
select and pay for MetaCerts 
security services. 
Integration for SMEs is automated 
and easier than buying an SSL 
certificate for a website.
THE SOLUTION FOR SMES 
ON APP MAKING PLATFORMS
7 No hardware or software required. 
It takes 30 seconds for an 
Enterprise customer to add 
MetaCert to HipChat. 
Only one person is required to 
install our integration for it to work 
across every device in the 
organization.

THE SOLUTION FOR TEAM 
COLLABORATION THE SOLUTION FOR TEAM 
COLLABORATION
MetaCert monitors every 
message, alerting users when a 
malicious link has been detected. 
MetaCert has built the worlds first 
anti-spear phishing solution for 
Team Collaboration. 
Users can flag and immediately 
warn IT about new malicious links
before harm is done. 
9 THE SOLUTION FOR TEAM 
COLLABORATION
We make MetaCert more sticky 
by providing message analytics 
for Management. 
Management can monitor the 
type of websites that staff share 
across all messages. 
Management can easily find out 
which websites are mostly 
accessed across the organization.

Adrian works for Intuit. Hes working 
from home and about to open a link 
inside HipChat
Every link is checked 
against MetaCerts treat

SMEs APPENDIX Our original mission was to secure integrations with every smart phone and 
tablet in the world, to solve the problem of Internet Safety for kids. 
Between 2011 - 2014 we raised $1.2M to build crawling technology, a content 
classification platform (threat intelligence system) and consumer products to 
show potential partners how to make use of our data. 
After winning a competitive pitch with Samsung and Apple for integration with 
over 1.3 BILLION devices, both companies decided that the timing wasnt right for 
them. So they decided not to proceed with the integrations. 
Due to a reduced market size, we decided to build a new Security API and 
change our business model to Mobile Security, which is now a bigger opportunity. 
COMPANY HISTORY
2 3 MetaCerts patent application will prevent other companies from checking 
the security level of URLs inside apps. 
MetaCert has the full support of HipChat - they will help sell our Security 
Integration - this will make it difficult for a competing service to win 
enterprise customers in this space. 
MetaCert is being integrated with the worlds biggest app making platforms - 
once integrated, its extremely unlikely that a platform reseller would want to 
offer a competing service. 
Google has a similar API service for desktop browsers, but its extremely 
complicated when compared with MetaCerts. Google doesnt have any 
Developer Tools or Platform integrations. Our patent application will prevent 
Google from offering their service to app publishers. 
MetaCert has built the worlds most advanced threat intelligence platform. 
We have crawled and classified the largest dataset of categorized URLs and 
IP addresses - with the worlds lowest error rate of false positives at 0.3%. 
Our technology can be used to classify IoT devices.

MOBILE SECURITY LANDSCAPE MOBILE SECURITY LANDSCAPE
Google
is MetaCerts only competitor 
to defend apps from malware 
& phishing URLs. But it does 
not support any other 
category. And their Safe 
Browser API is much more 
complicated than MetaCerts.
Google has no platform
integrations at this time so 
MetaCert benefits from faster 
adoption. 
Google will be infringing on 
MetaCerts patent should it be 
approved in February 2016.
Good Technology
does not offer a service 
that defends applications 
from malicious URLs or
unwanted content.
MetaCert
is the 1st to defend apps 
from malware & phishing 
URLs. And the only 
company in the world, to 
defend applications from
pornography + 59 
additional categories of 
web content. 
The MetaCert API is 
designed with developers 
in mind, with a distribution 
model that hasnt been 
addressed before now. 
Patent application pending. 2 6
Veracode
does not offer a service
that defends applications
from malicious URLs
or unwanted content. WHAT IS AN IN-APP BROWSER 
(WEBVIEW) IN PLAIN ENGLISH?
WebView is a code library provided Apple & Google to help 
developers display web content inside iOS and Android apps. 
Developers use a WebView to give apps browser-like capability so endusers dont need to close the app to open links using a native browser. 
When the app ecosystems were first launched, Google & Apple couldnt 
have known the extent to which their WebViews would be used today - 
especially with hybrid apps being built entirely around a WebView. 
Hence the lack of security today. 
HTML5 was only released as a W3C Full Recommendation in 2014, 
making it possible for virtually anyone to publish hybrid apps using a 
DIY App Making Platform.
2 7 METACERTS WEB CATEGORIZATION 
PLATFORM IS PURE MAGIC!
When an end-user tries to share or open the image http://imgur.com/r/sex/
sex.html MetaCerts API sends a request to MetaCerts trusted database 
TrustServ, to see if it is safe to open or not. The syntax on the right is the 
response given to the API call. 
imgur.com is a reputable image sharing website used by millions of people. 
It would be wrong to categorize the entire site as XXX even though there is 
a large number of images that are nsfw uploaded on a regular basis. 
It is technically impossible for any company to classify images the minute 
they are uploaded - or even soon afterwards. So across the web, tens of 
millions of URLs go unclassified by MetaCerts competitors. 
MetaCerts unique system has classified imgur.com as image sharing and 
imgur.com/r/sex/ as XXX. This means every image uploaded to that folder 
will be automatically classified and therefore, detected by our Security API. 
This is pure magic. And its the reason MetaCert Founder Paul Walsh coinstigated the creation of the W3C Standard for web categorization, 
replacing PICS in 2009!

Oracle, IBM, Microsoft May Lose Business 
to Free Database Software MySQL
ComputerWorld 11 Feb 03
McNealy: ...if you want to save more money, make the default database MySQL.
It's free, it's bundled, you've got the whole open-source community working on 
making it better. If Yahoo and Google can run their entire operations on MySQL, 
then certainly there's a huge chunk of your operations you could run on it as well.
San Francisco Chronicle 14 Aug 02
Some major corporations, including 7-Eleven, Deutsche Telekom and Amazon.com, 
are migrating to Linux servers to take advantage of low- cost, open-source 
versions of data management software such as MySQL. MySQL 13 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

Disruptive Business Model
 Open Source/Linux software is a disruptive innovation that 
has the potential to seriously erode the traditional software 
business model by attacking the heart of its model  high margin 
software licensing fees. 
Merrill Lynch 24 Oct 2001
  the popularization of the Open Source movement continues 
to pose a significant challenge to the Company's business 
model 
Microsoft 10-Q, February 2003 MySQL 15 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
The Database Market
 is dominated by the Big Three
 Oracle, IBM and Microsoft command 83% of the market
 MySQL owns 0.02% of the market by revenue
 so the Big Three say MySQL is not a threat
 and that is fine with us, because
 MySQL commands an estimated 20% by installed 
base
 and makes money

MySQL - The Cathedral in the Bazaar MySQL 24 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Three Modes of Production
 Individuals order their productive activities
1. as employees in firms, following the directions of managers
2. as individuals in markets, following price signals
 and now, also
3. as groups of individuals in the world, following diverse 
motivational drives and social signals (rather than either 
market prices or managerial commands), successfully 
collaborating on largescale projects
 This third form of production has been dubbed
commons-based peer production
See research papers by Ronald Coase, Oliver Williamson (for items 1 and 2), and 
Yochai Benkler (for item 3). MySQL 25 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
MySQL Has 2 Modes of Production
 Two production modes
1. The Cathedral: employees of MySQL AB, following the 
directions of managers.
2. The Bazaar: individuals all over the world, following diverse 
motivational drives and social signals.
 Both modes are Quid pro Quo
 Employees receive salary and other benefits
 Individuals receive GPLd software, rapid bug fixing, rapid 
evolution, i.e. solutions to every-day problems, and, 
additionally, peer recognition
 Ideally for MySQL, it does not matter to an individual 
whether he is in the cathedral or in the bazaar, or 
both. MySQL 26 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
MySQL Community Goals
1. Grow installed base from present 4m to 40m
2. Continually activate and engage community
3. Outsmart, outposition and outpromote Postgres MySQL 27 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
1. Grow Installed Base 
from Present 4m to 40m
A. Make sure product is suitable for vast deployment 
and usage
B. Encourage the worlds most powerful distributors to 
distribute MySQL
C. Integrate with the worlds most popular software 
tools, platforms and servers
D. Ensure MySQL is used in as many FOSS projects 
as possible (FOSS = Free / Open Source Software) MySQL 28 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
2. Keep Community Active
 Actively engage in rich, honest, relevant and frank 
communication
 Encourage intelligent contributions to advance our 
source code
 Promote and augment our open source strategy
 Encourage and enable peer recognition MySQL 29 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
3. Outsmart Postgres
 Have financially viable business and go for goals 1. 
and 2. with perfection  and thats it MySQL 30 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Dual Licensing
 MySQL AB employs dual licensing for its product, the 
MySQL server. 
 This means that MySQL is available under a regular 
commercial licence for commercial customers, and 
under the GPL licence for those who live by the Free 
Software principles. 
 The product is technically the same under both 
licences, but the financials and the legal ramifications 
are different.
 It is up to the customer to decide what path he wants 
to follow and what licence to use. MySQL 31 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Common Open Source Objections
Lack of proper support
 MySQL operates worldwide 24/7 support since 1999
Lack of vendor accountability
 MySQL owns its product and takes full responsibility
Lack of vendor viability
 MySQL has made money since 1995
Lack of third-party software integration
 MySQL is working with Sun, Novell, Veritas and others to ensure 
interoperability
Lack of skilled staff
 There are more than 4 million installations worldwide and hundreds of 
thousands of skilled developers and administrators. Use the community. MySQL 32 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

 quota of $1.6m p.a.
 sales volume per sales mgr used for budgeting: $1m p.a.
 $1m  2x ($80k + $50k) = $740k contribution per sales mgr

Earnings Logic - Subscriptions
 A concept dubbed Automated Notification Service 
(ANS) is in early development
 Under ANS, customers are to receive automated, customised, 
relevant notifications of product and service changes directly to 
their email, with clickable links for activating the suggested 
operations (such as product updates, database health checks, 
etc.)
 Pricing to be determined, current assumption is $80-200 per 
person p.a.
 Value proposition based on convenience; the same information 
to be freely but not as conveniently available to the open source 
community
 Market potential estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of 
subscribers; subscriptions to be sold one by one or as

 MySQLs sales model is based 
on the fact that GPLd MySQL 
installations are in use in most 
organisations today, which
 reduces marketing costs
 shortens sales cycles
 Our order of priority for sales 
cases
1. Enterprise buys off-the-shelf 
app (and MySQL is the 
batteries included database)
2. Enterprise builds new app (inhouse or outsourced) where 
database choice is open
3. Enterprise rewrites old app

CIO Magazine Survey Nov 2002
 29% are using open source databases today, and for 33% it will 
be the predominant type of software for databases in five years
 The majority (64%) of companies surveyed are using open source
 CIOs say the greatest benefits from using open source are 
 lower total cost of ownership, 
 lower capital investment and 
 greater reliability and uptime compared to their existing systems. 
 IT executives report that open source provides 
 greater flexibility, control and 
 faster, cheaper application development. 
 All things equal, the majority of IT executives surveyed said they would choose open source

Our Enterprise Experience So Far
 Enterprises appear to be open to multi-vendor DBMS 
strategy (which wasnt the case earlier)
 Enterprises appear to be open to open source 
software
 Enterprises typically see DBMSs in three categories:
 High-end: Oracle, DB2
 Middle: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL
 Desktop: Microsoft Access
 Many enterprises signed 3-5 year DBMS deals in 
1999-2000 (and many overpurchased); those deals 
now are coming to expiration MySQL 66 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

vacant
PRESENT-DAY SITUATION:
- onerous prices and licensing 
terms
- vendor lock-in
- products have too many features
- products continue to have bugs
- mandatory DBAs
- performance requires tuning
- little bang for the buck
+ ISV aspect: Big Three DBMS vendors 
compete with many of their own ISVs in 
the application space
DESIRABLE SITUATION:
- compelling prices, low up-front 
investment
- open standards, open software 
stacks, open source
- products with just the right 
amount of features
- battle-tested products
- minimal admin overhead
- superior performance
- great bang for the buck MySQL 67 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

How to Sell to the Enterprise
 CIO thinking
 a DBMS is just one piece in the puzzle
 how easy is it to retrain existing staff?
 here I will use Open Source, here not
 I dont want another vendor

Cost-Effectiveness is a Must
 To keep prices low and our profitability high, we must
 Keep the customer acquisition (and retention) cost low
 see next slide
 Keep the product development cost low
 through open source
 Keep COGS low
 by focusing on selling high-margin offerings (licences and 
automatic subscription services)
 by automating the labour involved in providing services MySQL 70 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Keep the Customer Acquisition Cost Low
 Seed the market with GPLd software
 and reduce need for advertising and promotion
 and shorten sales cycles
 Build a strong brand
 and shorten sales cycles
 and reduce price sensitivity among customers
 and sell more online
 Sell batteries included MySQL to ISVs and platform vendors
 and get straight into the enterprise in one low-cost blow
 Sell online
 and reduce the need for an expensive sales force
 Sell direct
 and avoid spending money on a multi-tiered sales channel
 Make buying easy
 (by simple pricing, simple configuration, web-enabled processes)
 and close more deals per account manager MySQL 71 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

Proposition to CIO
 MySQL offers 
 all essential functionality
 at a compelling upfront cost
 and a compelling on-going maintenance cost
 thus enabling organisations to continue to roll out new 
applications while meeting the cost-cutting targets set
 And, by the way,
 you already run MySQL in these products: ...
 this is open source, like Linux
 there are millions of people with MySQL skills
 and these are some of our top customers, partners and investors:

Stepwise Approach
Step 0 
Demonstrate MySQL viability 
in web and OEM markets
 Done, and ramp up continues
Step 1 
Demonstrate MySQL viability 
in enterprise market
 Work closely with select Fortune500 
companies and existing enterprise 
customers
 Forge key partnerships with ISVs 
and platform vendors
 Acquire and develop skill sets 
needed
 Build MySQL Enterprise 
(evolutionarily from MySQL Pro)
 Position MySQL in the market
 Enter select market segments
 Test our assumptions
 Test our ambitions
Step 2 
Ramp-up
 Perfect the offering
 Expand into other segments
 Expand geographically
 Penetrate
Steps 1 and 2 overlap, and 
business build-up will be continuous. 
We estimate that Step 1 will be concluded within 
2-3 years and require funds of up to 10m. MySQL 86 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Assumptions & Ambitions of Step 1
Assumptions
 Open source is enterprise-ready and 
enterprises are open source-ready
 Most platform vendors are open to a 
fourth db player
 Key ISVs are open to a fourth db player
 Key SIs are open to a fourth db player
 Batteries included gains ground in the 
enterprise and single db strategy loses 
ground in the enterprise
 Enterprise dbs increasingly need to be 
web-enabled 
 Mid-market is active (as opposed to toptier enterprise market)
 The Big Three are unable to successfully 
defend their perimeters
Ambitions
 Have enterprise db ready in 3-4 years
 Have revenue model that works in 
enterprise arena
 Build strong brand recognition and 
credibility among enterprise decision 
makers
 Keep customer acquisition cost down
 Price at roughly 1/3 of legacy players 
without compromising own profitability MySQL 87 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

Can the Competition Produce 
Something Better?
 By starting from scratch?
 Hardly. It takes 10 years for any mission-critical software product to 
mature.
 By opensourcing a closed-source product?
 Hardly. It takes years (or an eternity) for closed-source software to 
become clean enough go gain open source acceptance.
 By improving an existing open source product?
 Perhaps. But note that MySQL is today several times more popular 
than the next runner-up.
 By forking a new version based on MySQL?
 Anybody is free to modify and distribute MySQL under GPL, but 
maintaining the code is extremely difficult for anyone but the core 
development team of MySQL AB. Also, only MySQL AB can sell 
commercial licences and use the MySQL name.
 By giving away an existing product free of charge?
 May happen, but that does not make the product open source or 
superior. MySQL 113 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

This Round
 MySQL AB believes that a fair pre-money value of the company 
presently is 28m (but please note that this is not a formal offer, and 
that the valuation may change due to significant events in the 
company)
 The company now wishes to raise 10m
 In conjunction with the round a new share option pool will be launched, 
to grow its percentage from existing 6.92% up to 9% of outstanding 
shares
 The company is looking for one new active investor (or syndicate of 2) 
from the UK or USA or continental Europe
 The company may in parallel receive investment from strategic 
partner(s)
 The company presumes that the existing shareholders agreement be 
extended to cover new investors as well

Selection Criteria
 MySQL AB reserves the right to accept or decline 
offer letters at its discretion after the offer letter 
deadline 
 MySQL AB will pay great attention to the following 
selection criteria:
 relevant market experience and value-add of the investor
 personal chemistry between partner(s) in charge and MySQL 
management and directors
 valuation
 adherence to the existing shareholders agreement
 how well the VC matches The Ideal Investor list which was 
authored by the MySQL management (see next page) MySQL 123 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
The Ideal Investor
 The ideal investor in MySQL, in addition to bringing great tangible and 
intangible value to the company:
 takes a long-term view on his investment
 understands and respects the open source philosophy of MySQL AB (as 
demonstrated by MySQL AB and other open source companies such as 
Trolltech and Sleepycat)
 understands and respects the Nordic management culture (as 
demonstrated by Nokia, VOLVO, MySQL AB and others)
 understands and respects the MySQL core values as described at: 
www.mysql.com/company/index.html
 has ample industry experience and a vast network of relevant contacts
 is at all times actively engaged in building a long-term viable business for 
MySQL AB through active participation in board work and otherwise
 lives up to and demands from others a business conduct of the highest 
ethical standards
 in summary, is a value-adding contributor rather than a zero-sum game 
player. MySQL 124 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Offer Letter
 The signed letter from an interested investor shall be presented to the 
company no later than 18 March 2003, covering the following topics at 
a minimum:
 Proposed investment size (and distribution between syndicated partners, if 
applicable)
 Proposed pre-money valuation
 Proposed partners of the VC firm who would be board members and in 
charge of the investment for the VC, and list of references for such partners
 Detailed comments on any proposed deviations from the existing 
shareholders agreement to be disclosed to parties interested in submitting 
an offer letter
 Proposed timetable and execution plan for completing the transaction
 The investors comments on the business plan and projections, in order to 
highlight:
 where there is agreement
 where there is disagreement or just doubt 
 where there is an alternative proposal from the investor
 what may be missing in the investors view
 Any other information deemed valuable MySQL 125 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Exit Potential
 Without the investment, the company estimates it can reach up to 100m in annual revenues. With the 
investment now at hand, the management estimates the potential to rise to some 200m and beyond. 
 If the company is successful in its undertakings in the next few years and if the market develops as 
anticipated, the management believes that the company can grow to a size 2-5 times bigger than above 
depicted, given that appropriate additional growth funding is available.
 The management and owners are committed to building a company with a sustainable business for the long 
term. It is anticipated that the company will be able to float on an internationally acknowledged stock 
exchange in the next 3-4 years and continue as an independent entity for the foreseeable future.
 As a result of successful execution of the business plan, it is also likely that opportunities will emerge for a 
trade sale to a major platform, software, or database player in the market. Such companies presently 
include but are not limited to: Sun, HP, IBM, CA, Dell, SAP, Intuit, Microsoft, Oracle. No such discussions 
have been conducted or initialised.
 The founders of MySQL AB have stated their intention to build a great business and their interest to find the 
best possible future for the company  a future where the MySQL product can fulfill its mission of being 
available and affordable to all. MySQL 126 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

MySQL in a nutshell
 MySQL is an RDBMS, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL 
Server, IBM DB2 and others
 MySQL is designed for mission critical applications, 
where performance and reliability are key
 MySQL runs on most operating systems
 MySQL interfaces with most programming languages
 MySQL aims to have everything necessary, and 
nothing more: ACID transactions, replication, 
interfaces
 MySQL is available both under GPL and a 
commercial licence  dual licensing MySQL 131 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
MySQL Customer Value:
Saving time, in many ways
 Performance / speed
 Reliability
 Ease of use
 easy installation
 limited complexity
 many interfaces
 Low total cost of ownership
 low licence fees (at times free of charge)
 low support costs
 lower hardware costs, longer economic lifetime
 low training and administration costs (low complexity) MySQL 132 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
How MySQL Software Develops
 Core development
 done by salaried employees of MySQL AB worldwide
 Assimilation
 licensing (InnoDB, Berkeley DB) or acquisiton (JDBC driver) 
of technology developed in the open source community
 Contributions
 case-by-case contributions by individuals and companies 
(where ownership is transferred to MySQL AB)
 Community
 some add-ons and APIs that remain in community ownership 
(such as Perl-DBI and PHP-MySQL connection) MySQL 133 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Principles of Software Development
 Bugs are bad
 Modular design
 Compact code
 Release early, release often
 Never let new features compromise speed
 Make the product easy to install - easy and practical 
to use
 Document while coding
 Do it right the first time, every time MySQL 134 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Ultra-Conservative Versioning
 Not one single release leaves the company until all known 
repeatable fatal bugs have been fixed or properly documented
 Alpha
 first public release of a new version
 Beta
 feature freeze
 many old customers put betas in production use
 Gamma
 beta turns to gamma when one month has passed without fatal bugs
 Production
 gamma turns to production when one month has passed without fatal 
bugs MySQL 135 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Four Concurrent Source Trees
 Presently (Feb 03)
 3.23 - production version
 4.0 - in gamma
 4.1 - in alpha
 5.0 - being worked on
 All versions available for public scrutiny at

Where are the limits of MySQL?
 Database size: Hundreds of gigabytes in practice
 Scalability: >90 replication slaves at mobile.de, 
>2,500 queries per second in a single server at 
mainchat.de
 Features: Subselects in 4.1, Stored Procedures, Triggers, 
referential integrity of foreign keys in 5.0, then Views
 Limitation unimportant in new applications
 Porting of existing applications easier to 4.1 and 5.0
 The most important limits of MySQL lie in user perceptions
 Decision makers may know little about MySQL and Open Source MySQL 142 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

 multi-table deletes, updates
 improved replication MySQL 156 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Handler (Navigation) Interface
 Used when porting old database application with a 
navigational (direct ISAM) interface
 Also useful when you are doing a userinterface that 
navigates a lot of data
 This interface gives ""Dirty"" reads (but no other 
MySQL commands are affected!)
 HANDLER table_name OPEN;
 HANDLER table_name READ index_name > 
(""Banana"") LIMIT 10;
 HANDLER table_name READ index_name 
PREVIOUS; MySQL 157 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Multiple table DELETE
 Allows you to delete rows in multiple tables bases of 
conditions from multiple tables
 Like saying that you want to delete all rows found by 
a SELECT
 Syntax inspired by MS Access
 DELETE t1,t2 FROM t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id and 
t2.id=t3.id MySQL 158 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Dynamic Setting of Variables
 Change options on the fly (per thread and globally)
 No need to restart server to change cache sizes
 Possible to set larger buffers for specific commands
 SET GLOBAL SORT_BUFFER=1*1024*1024
 This will set the sort buffer (used by ORDER BY queries) for 
all new connections 
 SET SESSION SORT_BUFFER=32*1024*1024
 Will set the same buffer but only for the current connection
 SELECT @@GLOBAL.SORT_BUFFER
 Returns the default size of the variable MySQL 159 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Query Cache
 Improves the speed of queries on read mostly tables. 
Most (all?) websites has some query that will run 
many times a second
 3x speed improvement for web sites not uncommon 
 Does not change semantics at all!
 To enable add a line to my.cnf
 query_cache_size = 128MB
 Or set it on a running server
 SET 
@@GLOBAL.QUERY_CACHE_SIZE=128*1024*102
4
 Turns the Query Cache on with 128 MB memory MySQL 160 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Replication
 Replication uses two threads
 One to read the all queries and store them on disk in case
 One to do the updates
 This makes sure that the slave always catches up to the 
latest changes even if it was executing a slow update when 
the server went down
 LOAD DATA INFILE commands are now replicated 
properly MySQL 161 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
4.0: Other Features

High Availability by Replication
 MySQL supports many sites that need high reliability
 This is done by ""mirroring"" the data to many machines
 The single Master logs all SQL commands that 
update data
 Slaves connect to the master or another slave to 
read, and rerun the updates
 Examples of users are 
 Yahoo
 Slashdot.org
 Mobile.de (used car broker, over 300M page views/month) MySQL 175 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

Storage Engines
 A storage engine is a low level data storage / retrieval 
module (disk or memory)
 This allows you to choose locking and speed trade 
offs per table (instead of when choosing db!)
 MySQL supported multiple storage engines from the 
very beginning
 CREATE TABLE (key int, value char(10), PRIMARY 
INDEX key) TYPE=HEAP;
 ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=InnoDB; MySQL 176 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database

Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Storage Engine: MyISAM
 Developed by MySQL AB (replaced original ISAM)
 Static, dynamic and compressed (read-only) row 
formats but no transactions
 Text and compressed indexes
 Data and indexes in separate files 
 Fast read/write performance but low r/w concurrency
 Extremely good concurrency in the select and insert 
at end case (logs)
 External check and repair program (myisamchk)
 Especially useful for websites & logging MySQL 178 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Storage Engine: Hash/InMemory
 Developed by MySQL AB
 Completely in Memory with very fast hash based 
indexing
 Useful for
 Temporary tables
 Lookup tables
 Bad for range queries (Already fixed in MySQL 4.1) MySQL 179 : The Worlds Most Popular Open Source Database
Copyright 2003 MySQL AB
Storage Engine: InnoDB
 Actively developed code from InnoBase Oy & MySQL 
AB
 Full transactions (ACID) with versioning row level 
locking with automatic cleanup (no vacuum!)
 Consistent reads (Oracle style MVCC)
 Better concurrency than MyISAM for read/write on 
the same table
 Uses table spaces instead of individual files
 MySQL AB provides full support for InnoDB
 Is included in MySQL 4 & the MySQL Max binarys
 Has now been in active use under heavy load. Was

71,"Why do some startups get 
funded? What makes for the 
best pitch? How does the 
process work?
DocSend recently teamed up with Professor 
Tom Eisenmann from Harvard Business School. 
Together, we conducted research that gave 
us the answers to those questions. We studied 
the fundraising of 200 startup companies as 
they went through their Series Seed and Series 
A rounds. Altogether, these companies raised 
more than $360 million.
from 
$360M
Who Raised
200 Startups
What We Learned
200 COMPANIES $360M RAISED
$ DocSend is a sales enablement tool 
that tracks per-page analytics on 
document usage and is a popular 
way for founders to send pitch decks 
to investors. This put us in a unique 
position to conduct this study.
All of the companies that we chose 
through our selection process opted 
into the research. In addition to 
sending their decks to investors using 
DocSend, they answered a detailed 
questionnaire on what the overall 
fundraising process was like. Some 
of the companies that participated 
include August Locks, Panjo, Shift 
Cars, Back to the Roots, Wiser, Tiggly, 
20twenty, Boomtrain, and mNectar.
2 Here are some of our main findings:
Stats From an Average Series Seed Raise
Starting a company is a brutal process. Getting outside funding is a necessary step for many tech 
startups, but its an opaque and frustrating process for those doing it for the first time. With that in mind, 
we wanted to shed some light on what a typical successful seed round looks like.

Seven Actionable Takeaways
If youre thinking of raising a seed round for your 
startup, here are seven take aways from hundreds 
of companies who successfully raised.
Keep your deck to 20 pages or 
fewer. Each visit will only be 3m 
44sec on average.
More meetings does not equal 
more money. Focus on getting 
quality introductions to investors 
who are likely to be a fit. Quality 
over quantity.
Youll likely need to contact 20-30 
investors. But you wont need to 
contact hundreds.
Dont list your deal terms in your 
deck. Deliver them in person. 
The terms can vary by investor.
Spend time on your deck. 
Specifically, make sure your 
team slide looks awesome. If you 
include a financial slide, which is 
optional, remember itll be your 
most viewed.
Raising seed funding will take 
longer than you think. Dont start 
to despair until youve been at it 
for a few months.
Try to raise from a seed firm 
before you go to angels. Firms 
will give you more money in 
less time with fewer meetings.

5 Designing a Successful Seed Deck
The average length of the seed decks we studied was roughly 19 pages, and most had a similar format. 
The following table shows the types of pages used in the average order by the frequency in which 
they occurred. This table also notes the average length for each section of the deck, if that figure was 
included. We categorized pages according to Sequoia Capitals list of recommended categories.

Recommended Deck Ordering
The ordering of the sections was fairly standard, except for the team page. This page appeared either 
at the beginning or the end, but never in the middle. Within the 200 companies we studied, more 
companies placed the page at the end and not the beginning. This practice is in line with advice from 
Reid Hoffman, who advises companies to lead with their investment thesis, not a team page.

Viewers studied the average successful 
deck for 3 minutes, 44 seconds. This time 
might not sound like much, but the length 
was more than we expected. Compare that 
time to DocSends own pitch deck, viewed 
on average for a little more than two 
minutes. Twelve percent of investors read 
the pitch decks from their mobile phones 
as well, so make sure your deck looks OK 
on a tiny screen.
The Average Pitch Deck View
8 Which Pages Matter the Most
A few questions arise: Where was this view time spent within the pitch? If you spend extra time fixing up 
your deck, which pages should you focus on? Where should you anticipate questions? The following 
table shows the average time spent per page in each category.
Interestingly, although the financial category takes the place, only 57 percent of successful decks 
have this section. The low rate of inclusion is mostly due to the fact that many seed stage firms do not 
yet have financial results on projections. Almost all of the seed decks, and many of the A decks, dont 
contain any significant financials to discuss.
If you include financials, be very thoughtful with the content, as viewers will spend the most time on this 
section. Ensure your team slide, whether at the end or the beginning, also looks amazing.
One thing thats important to note is that almost no decks listed the amount they were raising and the 
terms of their fundraise. This information is always better delivered in person, and can vary from investor 
to investor.

10 Surviving the Fundraising Process
A Matter of Time
How long does a typical seed round take to raise? Within DocSends data set, on average, the round 
took 12 1/2 weeks. However, we saw much variation around this average. One-fifth of the companies 
took 20 weeks or longer, and another one-fifth took six weeks or fewer. The longest successful round 
took 40 weeks to close.
Companies that failed to successfully raise funds gave up after an average of 6.7 weeks. These 
companies may have failed simply for lack of patience: the companies that had successful rounds 
reported that the process took longer than expected. We asked the research participants to rate the 
actual length of their fundraising round against their expectations. On a scale of one to five, where three 
was as expected and five was waaaaay longer, the average response for seed rounds was 3.6.
Certainly, while patience is beneficial for startups, knowing when to give up, take a step back, and 
take a fresh look at the situation is important. Three-fourths of the companies that failed to raise 
seed funding planned to try again, and the average time until they plan to restart their efforts is 8.9 
weeksplenty of time to make progress on their business and incorporate feedback.

11 Strive for Quality, Not Quantity, of Investors
Its tempting to think that the more investors 
you contact, the better your chances of raising 
money. Unfortunately, this situation isnt the 
case. Certainly, the more investors you contact, 
the more meetings youll get, up to a point.
Note: in the data reported here, an entrepreneur 
could have multiple meetings with one investor, 
making it possible to have more meetings than 
investors contacted.
Contacting more investors will get you more 
meetings, but it wont necessarily get you more 
money. Focus on the quality of your connection 
to the investors you contact. In this graph, we 
compare the number of investors contacted 
and the amount of funding raised. There 
isnt much correlation, and if anything, the 
impression is a bit negative.

12 How Much and From Whom to Raise
Earlier, we noted the average seed round in DocSends data set was $1.3 million. The amount and 
the process, however, varied widely depending on whether the entrepreneur raised from angels or 
a seed firm.
Angel investors are wealthy individuals who give their own money to a project; they typically give 
between $25,000 and $100,000. Seed firms are small venture capital funds that pursue investments 
on a full-time basis. These firms usually invest between $250,000 and $1 million in a project.

What to Do and When to Give Up
Create a list of 30 investors you feel would be particularly passionate about your pitch. Most of the 
startups in our data set had to contact only 20 to 30 investors to close their round.
If none of them agree to invest, something may be off about what or how youre pitching. Take their 
feedback seriously and make some changes to your pitch before contacting more investors. If you still 
havent closed investors after contacting 100 of them, you should seriously rethink either your timing in 
the market or the project. A few companies raise money after contacting more than 100 investors, but 
that scenario is rare and a big drain on your time.
13 The following are a few of the key trade-offs:
Angels are typically operators, 
so they can relate and have a 
personal interest in your 
project. Because you'll have a 
few angels in your round, you'll 
have a sizable support group 
behind you.
Angels Seed Firms
These firms have professional, 
savvy investors. The firms 
invest more, so they have a 
greater financial interest in 
seeing you succeed. Firms also 
have more money to give you 
later if you need it.
Pros
Angels have busy lives and 
fluctuating funds, so you may 
not always be able to rely on 
them for the money and 
support you need. You also 
need to sell to more of them for 
a round.
Firms may try to control your 
business decisions, and they 
aren't always qualified to give 
you the best advice. Firms also 
see a lot of deals, so it's hard to 
get their attention.
Cons
Angels vs Seed Firms
14 The following summarizes the differences:
Firm Rounds: Rarer but Better
In general, angel-led seed rounds are much more common than firm-led seed rounds. According to 
David S. Rose, an angel investor, seed firms fund about 1,500 startups each year while angels fund 
roughly 50,000. This discrepancy is partially because seed firms invest in about one of every 400 
companies they consider, while angels choose one out of every 40. Those numbers are by no means 
exact, but they do illustrate that if you wish to get a firms attention, you need to have an outstanding 
pitch deck and know the selling points of your business inside and out.
According to DocSends data, although angel-led seed rounds are more common, firm-led rounds have 
much more favorable characteristics. If you are able to raise funds from a firm, youll get twice as much 
money in 30 percent less time. Youll also need to contact only 40 percent as many investors. 
Our recommendation is to try raising from a Seed Fund first.

15 Series A vs Series Seed Rounds
Series A rounds are much less common than seed rounds. In DocSends data set, nine seed rounds 
existed for every series A round. It appears that the Series A Crunch is still in effect. Although we have 
fewer data points, we managed to collect some statistics on the differences between seed and A rounds.
If you are able to raise a Series A round, the process is easier than for a seed round. A rounds take less 
time, yield more money, and require fewer investors than seed rounds.
Series A rounds 
took an average 
of 9.6 weeks, 24 
percent less time
than the time given 
for the average 
seed round.
During A rounds, 
companies contacted 
an average of 26 
investors, versus 58 
investors contacted
for seed rounds.
During A rounds, 
companies had on 
average 30 investor 
meetings, versus 40 
investor meetings for 
seed rounds.
The average money 
raised during seed 
rounds was just 
under $1.3 million, 
where the money 
raised during A 
rounds was more 
than $8 million.

16 Easiest Markets for Seed Funding 
Consumers needs and other 
economic conditions impact which 
business models receive the 
greatest success during fundraising. 
While trends are always fluctuating, 
in the past 12 months, four types of 
companies stood out as having the 
most success during seed rounds: 
consumer, business, marketplace,
and hardware.
On average, marketplace 
companies raised the most money 
in their seed rounds. Successful 
marketplace businesses are quite 
rare, but when they work, theyre 
also much bigger, like Uber or 
Airbnb. Raising money for a 
marketplace startup takes a long 
time. Although theres a lot of money 
for companies in these categories, 
convincing investors that your 
startup is going to win takes longer.
The following are some of the key statistics on the fundraising 
efforts of the four types of business models:

To Recap, Seven Key Takeaways
Fundraising for your startup can be an opaque and 
frustrating process when the future of your business 
is on the line. Keep these take aways in mind to 
maximize your chances of successfully raising a 
seed round.
Keep your deck to 20 pages or 
fewer. Each visit will only be 3m 
44sec on average.
More meetings does not equal 
more money. Focus on getting 
quality introductions to investors 
who are likely to be a fit. Quality 
over quantity.
Youll likely need to contact 20-30 
investors. But you wont need to 
contact hundreds.
Spend time on your deck. 
Specifically, make sure your 
team slide looks awesome. If you 
include a financial slide, which is 
optional, remember itll be your 
most viewed.
Raising seed funding will take 
longer than you think. Dont start 
to despair until youve been at it 
for a few months.
Try to raise from a seed firm 
before you go to angels. Firms 
will give you more money in 
less time with fewer meetings. 
Dont list your deal terms in your 
deck. Deliver them in person. 
The terms can vary by investor.

TURNING
DATA
INTO VALUE
Recent breakthroughs in big data analysis and 
AI have improved our ability to build neural 
networks that can process massive amounts 
of raw and unlabeled data. Because of this, we 
can achieve accuracy higher than ever before, 
a revolution that will sweep across many 
industries. Year after year, deep learning is 
pushing AI into new territory, breaking accuracy 
records and leading to new products.
Data is meaningless without tools that help you 
make decisions. Unfortunately, many companies 
are unable to extract value and insight from their 
data. AI will change that, and deep learning is at 
the forefront of AI. With production-grade deep 
learning tools, enterprise teams can learn from 
their data more quickly, responding to the world 
in real-time.

MACHINES THAT PERCEIVE THE WORLD
Deep learning is the fastest-growing and most advanced field in machine learning. 
It uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to find patterns in unstructured data such as 
images, sound, video and text.
Deep learning has achieved record breaking performance on widely used datasets 
such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In many competitions, the only algorithm deep learning 
competes against is itself. www.skymind.io help@skymind.io

Deeplearning4j
Deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade, open-source, 
distributed deep-learning library written for Java and Scala. 
Integrated with Hadoop and Spark, DL4J is specifically designed to 
be used in business environments on distributed GPUs and CPUs.
ND4J: Numpy for the JVM
ND4J is a scientific computing library for the JVM. Its Numpy for 
Java and Scala. It is built for efficiency in production environments, 
not as a research tool, so routines are designed to run fast with 
minimum RAM requirements.
DataVec
DataVec is an Apache 2.0 licensed open-source tool for machine 
learning ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The goal of 
DataVec is to transform and preprocess raw data into usable 
vector formats across machine learning tools.
Arbiter
A tool dedicated to evaluating and tuning machine learning 
models. Part of the DL4J Suite of Machine Learning / Deep 
Learning tools for the enterprise. 
OPEN SOURCE
DEMOCRATIZING THE DEEP LEARNING INDUSTRY
At Skymind, we believe collaborative and transparent contributions are key 
to making deep learning mainstream. All Skymind products, such as DL4J, ND4J, 
DavaVec, JavaCPP and Arbiter are 100% open-source and maintained by the most 
active deep learning community in existence.

Skyminds suite of tools takes advantage of the latest distributed computing 
frameworks including Hadoop and Apache Spark to improve model training.
FIRST COMMERCIAL-GRADE, 
OPEN-SOURCE, DISTRIBUTED 
DEEP LEARNING LIBRARY
Deeplearning4j is the most widely used open-source deep learning tool 
for the JVM. Its aim is to bring deep learning to the production stack, 
integrating tightly with popular big data frameworks like Hadoop and 
Spark.
Deep learning excels at identifying patterns in unstructured data. 
This includes images, sound, time series and text.
SOUND TEXT TIME SERIES IMAGE VIDEO Deep Learning for Enterprise

WRITE ONCE, RUN EVERYWHERE
Javas popularity is only strengthened by its 
ecosystem. Most enterprises use Java or a JVMbased big data system. Hadoop is implemented 
in Java; Spark runs within Hadoops Yarn runtime; libraries like Akka made building distributed 
systems for Deeplearning4j feasible.
Were often asked why we chose to implement 
an open-source deep learning project in Java, 
when so much of the deep-learning community 
is focused on Python. And the answers are speed 
and security for enterprise deployment. www.skymind.io help@skymind.io

CASE STUDY: 
ORANGE SV
Orange is working with Skymind to prevent Subscriber 
Identity Module Box (SIMBox) fraud on its mobile 
network. Using an artificial neural network (ANN) called 
an autoencoder, Orange Silicon Valley analyzes call detail 
records (CDRs) to find patterns that identify fraud. The ANN 
also predicts the likelihood that an instance is fraudulent. 
Where a static rule system flags cases only as likely fraud 
or not, the ANN enables Oranges analysts to prioritize 
high probability cases of SIM Box fraud.
The problem is that fraud moves so quickly that it has 
been difficult for Oranges static algorithms to detect 
it, told by Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley www.skymind.io help@skymind.io

elwafeyat.com is the rst online 
platform for obituaries, memorials 
and condolences Announcing the death of a close family member is 
physically difficult, emotionally painful and socially 
awkward. The process is inconvenient for both the family 
and their network of friends.
PROBLEM
Its culturally very important for 
families to honour their loved 
ones and instantly get the news 
out, families either have to post in 
newspapers or they rely on informal tools. Newspaper annuncements are extremely expensive, 
inconvenient, and no longer have 
the expected wide reach. While 
social media and other informal 
tools lack value and dont necessarily reach the right people.
Friends have to get informed on 
time and attend the funeral. They 
do not have the right tools to send 
condolences and support the 
family during their hardship. They 
can post in the newspapers, send 
telegrams or use informal tools. 
Newspaper condolences are 
extremely expensive and do not 
reach everyone. Telegrams are 
inconvenient and informal tools 
are irrelevant. 
Family Friends - We decided to start with the Middle East as an entry point and then scale globally. Its a very under utilised 
region with untapped opportunities. 
- Arabs publish obituaries and condolences in hard copy newspapers because its the only available platform.
- Our market is composed of those who post obituaries (creators) and people who want to know who passed 
away to send condolences (subscribers)
- Taking Egypt as an example, 0.5m people die every year. Because newspapers are costly and dont have a wide 
reach ( less than 4% penetration), only 4.7k obituaries are posted annually (1% of deaths). The average price of 
the post is as high as $1.5k. Our model allows us to acquire a bigger share of the already big market due to 
aordably and convenience by targeting a wider social classes.
- As for subscribers we are targeting the wider Arabic speaking population who want to stay up to date and 
send condolences. This market is as big as 300m out of which more than 45% are internet users and could be 
potential customers.
- The market is similar not only in other Arab countries but in African and Central Asian, so the model could be 
replicated and tailored for such markets Announcing the death 
and honoring the person:
- Online obituaries 
- Email obituaries 
- App announcements
- SMS shots
By integrating our service with 
social networks we easily map out 
peoples social connections to 
automatically notify them when a 
match is made.
Sending Condolences: 
People can pay their respects 
through innovative:
- Online condolences 
- Personalised letters, flowers, and 
packages
- Online initiatives to raise money 
for a charitable cause in the name 
of the deceased.
Process Facilitation:
We offer a directory of offline 
service providers and a guide to 
the steps that need to be taken 
when someone passes away.
- Mosques
- Churches
- Publications and florists
- Funeral services providers

Infrastructure for a Connected World Contents
 Founders
 Why AppNexus?
 Differentiation / Competitive Analysis
 Timeline
 Financials Founders
 Brian OKelley, CEO - former CTO of Right Media. 
Invented, built, sold, and launched the Right Media 
Exchange. Scaled the RM environment from 10 to 
1500 servers and felt the pain of not having 
AppNexus.
 Michiel Nolet, VP of Product - former Director of 
Analytics at Right Media. Why AppNexus Right Media challenges
 Scale - MySpace is going to send an extra 
1B imps/day of volume... next week
 Globalization - Yahoo! Japan wants to do a 
pilot, but only if servers are in Japan...
 Integration - lets integrate a contextual 
analysis platform... to all 6 datacenters... Solving the Problems
 Scale: Cloud computing would have been 
great - flip servers on when we need them
 Global: Multiple clouds, with smart routing / 
load balancing, in key geographies
 Integration: Run new services in-cloud Cloud Nexus 
 The cloud becomes a nexus where 
applications can consume services
 Cloud layer needs to be robust, reliable, 
easy-to-use, etc to get adoption
 Centralized directory, documentation, 
community, and billing for service providers Cloud Architecture Nexuses
 One Nexus isnt enough - applications are 
moving global quickly 
 Multiple Nexuses around the world, each 
with same services and applications
 Build tools to help scale applications (data 
tier especially) Revenue Sources
 Rent high-end 4-core boxes for around 
$10/core/day (virtualized, of course)
 Rent database boxes, storage, bandwidth, 
backup, and many other things too
 Profit-sharing with service providers
 Access fees Competitive Analysis Differentiators - Near Term
 Global (some tough problems to solve 
there - will be compelling)
 Ops tools (very challenging to build a 
scalable ops layer)
 Customer-centric (not exciting, but need to 
get the little things right - its a small world, 
and trust travels) Differentiators - Long Term
 With network effect (lots of services & lots 
of applications) will be difficult for a new 
cloud player to compete - will need to 
recruit the services to get the apps and will 
need to recruit the apps to get the services
 Lots of tools - idea is to get applications 
locked in to the AppNexus way Competition
 Amazon / EC2 (biggest risk - they have 
capital, the SOA concept, and momentum)
 Rackspace / Gridlayer (hosting companies 
have the hardware and the customer base, 
but probably not the SOA mentality)
 Google / Yahoo / MSFT etc (not in space 
now, but have the capex to enter) Growth Plan Ping pong growth
 First applications sign up for the cloud
 These clients become leverage to recruit 
software providers
 Co-market with software providers to get 
more applications on board
 Repeat... Phase 1: The Cloud
 Build-out and deploy robust physical and 
virtual infrastructure to underlie the 
Nexuses
 Can be profitable as a standalone service Phase 1 Logistics
 First location live Jan 2008; 2nd in Mar-Apr
 Work closely with initial clients to refine ops layers 
(monitoring, provisioning, cluster management tools) 
 Beta launch Jan 2008, Scale to 20 clients by mid-2008
 Ideal clients are platforms and services (natural SOA 
consumers and purchasers)
 Fund via $2-3MM seed round (plus $2MM of personally 
guaranteed debt) Phase 1 Pipeline
 Behavioral Marketing (Exelate, Blue Kai, 
Media Six Degrees)
 SaaS (Wide Orbit)
 Gaming (Garage Games)
 Video CDN (Digital Fountain) Phase 2: Credibility
 Go elephant hunting - recruit the 
platforms that will make all the services 
want to be in their Nexus (or vice versa)
 Aggressively brand as the high-end of the 
cloud market - graduate from EC2 
Competitor/Cloud-Computing provider
 Leverage key differentiators to keep 
pricing high; continue to build IP Phase 2 Logistics
 Start in Q3 2008
 Raise $10-15MM to ramp team, provide 
working capital for 2000+ servers
 Need global presence - market may be 
stronger (as is currency) overseas Phase 3: Nexus
 With key clients and critical mass, network 
effect begins to build
 Focus on comarketing with partners - help 
service providers recruit platforms & apps
 Provide arms to both sides of a war that 
never ends... Phase 3 Logistics
 Begin in early 2010
 Infrastructure side of business should be 
self-sustaining at this point, so shift to 
marketing, support, evangelism
 Be opportunistic about acquiring facilities
 Business should be profitable but raise $25-
50MM to expand (and compete) Financials",4

people, it would be their worst nightmare. For Cassandra Italia, however, it was the best thing that ever happened 
to her.
Italia was the only foreigner teaching English in a small Thai province near the Cambodian border in the mid2000s when she experienced a serious kidney problem and was rushed to hospital.
""I'd let my travel insurance lapse. So I was thinking: This is going to cost thousands of dollars and who knows 
what kind of care I'll get,"" Italia says. ""I ended up staying in my own room for five nights, having a barrage of 
tests and receiving phenomenal quality of care from the doctors. Not only did I feel safe, but it ended up costing 
less than $1000.""

of wealthy families, and one of the parents was an orthopedic surgeon who had studied at the University of 
Melbourne. It was quite common, he assured her, for Thai doctors to train in Australia, the US or Europe before 
returning home.

professionals. She found that thousands of people across Asia were travelling to Thailand for complex surgery,

OUR STATS
OUR HISTORY
Snapchat was created in 2011 by Evan Spiegel and Bobby 
Murphy  two close friends who wanted a more fun and 
personal way to communicate on mobile. Their solution was 
Snapchat, an ephemeral photo-messaging app. Soon they 
added captions, doodles and video to the platform and usage 
exploded to over 50 million Snaps viewed a day by the end of 
2012, growing to over 700 million today. 
In 2013 the team introduced Stories, Snaps threaded together 
to form a rolling flipbook of moments with each Snap living 24 
hours before it disappears. Users and brands quickly took to 
this new feature and today people view Stories over 1 billion 
times a day. 
Every piece of content a user views is triggered by pressing and 
holding the screen, meaning they consciously choose to 
engage with content. When people share, recipients pay 
attention, knowing all Snaps will eventually disappear.

In May 2014 Chat and Here were released. They make 
one-to-one communication even more seamless via direct
 messages and face-to-face video. In July 2014, Our Story 
launched. Our Story is a location-based collaborative Story that 
throws users into the crowd at a certain event. 
At Snapchat, were bridging the gap between the digital and 
real-world, and were just beginning 2 Confidential July 2014
We have many products within Snapchat, but there is one key 
feature that they all share: deletion. 
We believe in the integrity of conversation  personal, 
unguarded, and of the moment. 
Thats how it is with in-person conversations, and thats how we 
think it should be with mobile conversations as well. 
Our default is delete. Conversations are ephemeral unless 
someone chooses to save or screenshot them. And if they do, 
we do our best to make the sender aware. Just like a face-toface conversation content stays impermanent unless someone 
goes out of their way to record it.
DELETE IS OUR DEFAULT

Snapchat is one app with several functions. People use it to communicate one-to-one, one-to-few, 
and one-to-all. They share moments, not just pretty pictures, through stills and videos with added with 
captions, doodles, or filters to make them even more fun and personal.

SNAP
A 1- 10 second photo or video sent to one or a few friends that disappears after viewing. 
DEFINITION
WHAT USERS SNAP
People send Snaps of their morning commute, late 
night nachos, and everything in between. 
Some Snaps are crazy, some more mundane, but 
all Snaps are personal  raw moments, not just 
pretty pictures. 5 Confidential July 2014
STORY
Snaps threaded together to create a flipbook of moments for all your friends to see. Each individual Snap lives for 24 
hours before it disappears. There is no limit to the number of Snaps you can add to your Story, and no rules for what you 
post. Anything goes.
DEFINITION
Your Story is a place for the Snaps you want all your 
friends to see. Some have cohesive narratives with 
beginning, middle, and ends. Others are collages 
of moments from the past 24 hours. Some make 
sense, others dont, but theyre all a collection of 
personal moments that reflect your unique experiences and emotions. 
WHAT USERS STORY
When a friend views your Story, they view it the way 
you lived it, not in reverse like most social feeds. A 
friends Snap is not mixed in with your aunts or that 
sorority sister that shares a bit too much. Instead, 
her content is tied together in one single Story, 
allowing you to catch up on whats happening in her 
life all at once. 6 Confidential July 2014

created from submissions
PHILOSOPHY
Our Story uses hours of user-generated content from an event to 
tell a story through varying points of view. Snaps are submitted 
with distinct perspectives, contrasting emotions, and diverse 
faces. We sift through them to make a sharp and immersive Story.
We curate to throw users into an event, not to editorialize it. We 
make viewing entertaining and effortless by cutting the 
inappropriate, extraneous, and repetitive, while staying 
unwaveringly true to the on-the-ground experience. 
EDC LIVE (33 HR. EVENT)
RIO LIVE (12 HR. EVENT)
Viewers saw Snaps of jumping crowds, DJs, tasty grilled cheeses, and even couples 
During the World Cup finals, viewers were brought into the stadium, onto the vibrant beaches, and even into the homes of those celebrating.

NOTE: To honor our obligations under 
federal law, we do not let users who 
indicate they are under 13 years old 
create a Snapchat account. 
Brands, sport teams, celebrities, and more are 
utilizing Snapchat to connect with fans. By 
using Snapchat just as individuals do, they are
connecting in an entirely new way. And the more 
they use it, the better they are becoming at this 
new form of storytelling.
We recommend experimentation. Learn what 
its like to create, what Stories fans find most 
compelling, and ultimately, what your Snapchat 
voice is.

- 1000memories 
- McKinsey 
 Mike Katchen, @mkatchen In May, we raised a $2MM seed round. It took us 
2.5 weeks to raise from 15 investors. Here are a 
few tips based on what I think we did right. Table stakes for seed rounds: 
1. Good idea (in a massive market) 
2. Killer team Investors follow the 
herd. They care more 
about who else is 
investing than what you 
do as a company. Dont 
go broad until you have 
your lead lined up.

Not sharing at this time sorry Tip #4: Set a deadline.
Lead Deadline Close
2 weeks
Once you have a leader investor, move fast to close your round. 
Closing will always take longer than you expect.
1-3 weeks  If you can afford it, investing in your own round goes a long way
 Signals to investors that you are committed, aligned, and will be 
a responsible steward of their capital
 Surprisingly few teams invest in their own rounds so it can also 
help you stand out.
Tip #5: Put some money in yourself (if you can). Great resources on fundraising

Connected2.me  Connected2.me is a global social network with 2.7 million registered users. 
Daily visitors and monthly new users are 200K and 100K per month, 
respectively. 
Its unique features are 
-Anonymity: It allows communication without revealing your identity. 
-Both web and mobile: Connected2.me runs on both web and mobile 
platforms. 
Revenues are generated by selling extra features to users and 
advertisements. Features include extra photo upload (US$0.5) and 
promotion of profile (US$2.0). Users can promote their profiles in the 
shuffle section of main page. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   PROBLEM
When you use WhatsApp or any other mobile messaging application, you can only 
communicate with other mobile users. You cannot chat with people who are using a 
computer. 
Also, you either need to give your phone number or add them on Facebook just to get 
messages when you are on mobile. There must be a way to chat while you are on mobile 
without giving up your privacy.  SOLUTION
In Connected2.me when you install the application you are given a link: connected2.me/user. 
Anyone going to that link can chat with you whether they are on mobile or on desktop. 
On mobile they are redirected to our application, and on desktop they can directly chat from a 
browser. You don't need to give your phone number, add them on Facebook, just give your 
link. They don't even need to register, they are given anonymous nicknames and start to chat 
with you immediately.

But what if there was

Solution Solution
We use machine learning to predict flight 
disruptions and proactively book travelers 
an alternate flight during expected 
disruptions for free.  With our predictive analytics, 
we can detect potential 
disruptions ahead of time 
and notify our travelers. We then immediately 
send them a list of all 
alternate flights.
With one click, they can 
choose a second flight
and we send them the 
boarding pass for free. Getting them home 
on-time and and on 
their terms. Target Travel Management Companies (TMCs)
TMCs help businesses handle their corporate travel needs.
They provide end-to-end support for a companys employee travel experience.
9,386+ TMCs in the US 90,000 Bookings on 
Average per TMC
471M+ Corporate Travel 
trips in 2018
Go-To-Market During flight disruptions, the process
of rebooking is frustrating and 
time-consuming, resulting in
decreased customer loyalty and trust.
Each time a client flies out, their TMC 
will keep a full team on call to 
manually monitor their flight. This is 
costly and inefficient.
A disruption will cost the clients 
company on average $1200 per 
employee, in the form of rebooking 
costs and loss of productivity.

Modelled on a $6M Series A The eShares Ownership Map
Edges are investments. Nodes are funds and companies. What is a Transfer Agent (TA)?
Transfer agents record changes of ownership, maintain the issuer's security holder 
records, cancel and issue certificates, and distribute dividends. Because transfer 
agents stand between issuing companies and security holders, efficient transfer 
agent operations are critical to the successful completion of secondary trades. 1

$ 2,020,058
$ 323,058
$ 93,358
$ 65,000
Fair Market Value
Companies purchase a 409A valuation for $3K to 
determine share price (common and preferred). And share the data with interested parties
Funds have to value the companys preferred shares.
Funds pay $500/company to value the shares in the 
portfolio. It is exactly the same valuation as the 409A. One set of data. Multiple customers. 
Value the company once and sells views into the data.
Offer the same valuation service at 80% discount and 
earn more revenue than any firm today.

SportHold is a website where fans predict what they think will happen in 
upcoming sports games by entering what they think the final score will be. founders@sporthold.com sporthold.com angel.co/sporthold
We then take their predictions to form one super prediction for each game using a powerful 
law known as the Wisdom of Crowds. We then sell those predictions back to our users. founders@sporthold.com sporthold.com angel.co/sporthold
In the past 4 months (before July 29th, 2014) weve had 6k signups make 
160k predictions. We use this data to make our super predictions.

e.g. Predicting key metrics like quarterly earnings for publicly traded stocks. founders@sporthold.com sporthold.com angel.co/sporthold
It can also be used within companies to predict key information important to operations.

339,"Next-Generation Car Service
1 Cabs in 2008
 Most use aging & inefficient technology 
 Radio dispatch, no 2-way communication  Most common car, Ford Crown Victoria = 14mpg
 Hailing is done by hand or phone 
 No GPS coordination between client/driver  Significant fareseeking or dead-time
2 The Medallion System
 Taxi-monopolies reduce quality of service
 Medallions are expensive, and drivers underpaid  Medallions cost ~$500k, drivers make 31k  No incentive/accountability for drivers/clients
 Digital Hail can now make street hail unnecessary
3 UberCab Concept
 A fast & efficient on-demand car service  Market: Professionals in American cities  Convenience of a cab in NYC + experience of a 
professional chauffeur. But in SF and NYC 
 Latest consumer web & device technology 
 automate dispatch to reduce wait-time 
 Optimized fleets and incented drivers  The NetJets of car services
4 1-Click Car Service
 Must be a member to use the service 
 Professional and trustworthly clientele
 Not hailed from street 
 So no medallion licenses are required, since 
clients are service members & use digital-hail
 Guaranteed Pick-up (unlike a yellowcab) 
 Mobile app will match client & driver See photos of each other
5 Key Differentiators
 Members Only - Respectable clientele  1-click hailing  Pickup here in 5 mins  Fast Response time  easier than calling  Luxury automobiles  Mercedes Sedans  Great drivers  Rate your trip feature  High-tech solution: Geo-aware auto-dispatch  Optimized fleet  Logistical LBS software
6 Operating Principles
 Luxury service on-demand  Modern and fuel-efficient fleet  Customer-focused, computer-coordinated  The best end-user experience possible  Statistically optimized response time  Pre-paid, cashless billing system  Profitable by design
7 UberCab apps
 1-Click request from Geo-aware devices  SMS from any phone: pickup @work in 5
8 UberCab.com
 Book Trips, show Fleet status, trip history  Pre-specify locations with labels + coordinates 
 To enable easy texting of pickup locations 
 Google Maps integration 
 Lat/long for home, bob-work, alice-apt
9 Use-Cases
 Trips to/from restaurants, bars & shows  Fast local transport where parking isnt easy  Airport pickup/dropoff (pre-scheduled)  Working while commuting (wifi in cars) 
 3 person rideshare to a South-Bay campus 
 Dropping off Kids at School  Elderly transport
10 User Benefits
 Cabs dont guarantee pickup, can take 45 mins  Cab arent as safe or clean as limos  Car services require 1-3 hours notice  Car services transfers average over $60 + tax  UberCab would be faster & cheaper than a limo, but 
nicer & safer than a taxicab
11 Environmental Benefits
 Better Utilization of Vehicle Resources
 In NYC, 35% of time is spend looking for fares In less dense cities, can be over half dead-time As swarm size increases, efficiency will improve
 Hybrid vehicles (2x efficiency of a cab) 
 Mercedes S400 BlueHybrid, Lexus GS-450h Reduce carbon footprint, better use of time in car
 Ridesharing/Carpooling incentives  lower rates 
 Trip to SFO, or Ballpark to Marina after a game
12 UberCab Fleet
 Premium  S550 for SF Beta clients 
 30mpg with S400 BlueHybrid (in 2010) 
 Standard  Lexus GS450h or e320 23mpg  Existing cab/towncar fleets get 14-16 mpg 
13 Initial Service Area
 Central SF to Start, Manhattan soon after
14 Technology
 Mobile phones + intelligent scheduling 
 Applications for iphone, blackberry, symbian  Operations research for route optimization
 Payment/utilization/reputation tracking  Patent-pending system design
15 Demand Forecasting
 Cars hover in statistically optimized positions 
 minimize expected pickup time given hour of week & 
weather/traffic conditions 
16 Overall Market
 $4.2B annually and growing  Top 4 players combined only 22% of revenues
17 Composition of Market
 Focus on Urban service on-demand  2007 Market
18 Target Cities
 Focus on SF/NYC to begin  Expand to LA, Chicago, Houston, PA, Dallas 
 This covers 50% of entire US market 
19 Potential Outcomes
 Best-Case Scenario 
 Becomes market leader, $1B+ in yearly revenue 
 Realistic Success Scenario 
 Gets 5% of the top 5 US Cities  Generates 20-30M+ per year profit 
 Worst-Case Scenario 
 Remains a 10 car, 100 client service in SF  Time-saver for San-Francisco based executives
20 SmartPhones, Aug2008
21 Future Optimizations
 Cheaper cars by buying used  Less expensive hybrid vehicles (prius)  More accurate GPS technology  Discounted rates for Sun-Tues multi-hour bookings  Pay premium for on-demand service get here now costs more than tomorrow at 5pm
22 Marketing Ideas
 YellowCab is the only recognizable brand 
 Become the ubiquitous premium cab service
 Invite Only, referred from an existing member  Possible slogan: The One-click cab  The NetJets of Limos  Cabs2.0
23 Location-Based Service
 Extend infrastructure to other LBS applications
 Delivery, non-critical medical/governmental use
 Growing to a $3.5B industry by 2010

Risks Mitigate Precautions
Lack of user commitment 
Low user referral rate
Existing competitors adding similar 
features
Technology patents filed;

integrate with a boxed product
Leverage high value, low time 
investment proposition for users; 
develop user community
Push high monetary value of utilizing 
suggestions; offer multiple choices
Develop name brand to assure high 
market penetration and growth rates; 
patent proprietary technologies
Slow initial growth
Utilize management teams superior 
know-how and clear viral marketing 
potential to ensure growth 14
Competitive Response
Attempts to copy MyMints
website and business model
Leverages brand name and 
market reach
Extensive experience and 
software specialization
Synergies with current 
software such as Quicken
Enforce patent protection of 
proprietary technology 
Satisfied users have little 
incentive to switch
Highly experienced 
management team
Technology extends beyond 
reach of existing software
No advantage
MyMint offers a 
unique product
Defensibility
Result
Delays Microsoft 
market entry and

Were always trying to find ways to integrate our systems 
and bring it all into one place so thats a great thing to 
build towards. No one wants to have 10 tabs open on 3 
different monitors just to stay in front of your business. 
And Front seems like a place where people enjoy living - 
like as a home screen. I mean, in our business, we just 
have a lot of different places where information is 
inputted and stored and we have to go to recover it. Front 
is where everybody meets, that's the intersection of all 
the information, its the place where everyone ends up 
residing to solve a given problem.

How a tiny Mom + Son consultancy became the world leader in SEO 
Software, and our roadmap to being Seattles next $1 Billion company
Rand Fishkin, CEO & Co-founder, SEOmoz
July 2011 Did you know? At one point, Rand + Gillian had just under $500K in personal debt. 
By 2007, it was all paid off, thanks to the magical super-awesomeness of SEO!
2004

1997
2001 Feb. 2007
Nov. 2007
Oct. 2008
Sept. 2010
July 2011
Gillian (Rands 
Mom) founds the 
company that will 
become SEOmoz
Rand starts working 
w/ Gillian building 
websites for small, 
local businesses
Rand drops out of 
UW, 2 classes from 
graduation to work 
full time w/ Gillian
Deeply in debt, and failing 
to get traffic to clients 
sites, Rand starts the 
SEOmoz Blog as part of 
learning the SEO process.
SEOmoz launches its 
first subscription 
software product, 
PRO for $39/month
SEOmoz takes an 
investment of $1.1M 
from Ignition Partners 
& Curious Office
Linkscape, SEOmozs web 
index and link graph, 
launches. By December, 
moz is profitable.
A Little Moz History (now in color!)
Mozs collection of tools 
becomes a singular, 
campaign-based web app. 
Prices rise to $99 / $499 / 
$1999 per month.
SEOmoz is moving from 
just SEO to social media, 
content marketing, 
analytics, local and video. 
To this end, weve 
acquired Moz.com. More about our history http://www.seomoz.org/blog/the-story-of-seomoz
Monthly
Visits
We took one round of 
financing in 2007; $1.1MM 
from Ignition + Curious Office
In 2009, we dropped 
consulting entirely
April of 2011, we 
hit 1.2+MM 
visits/month and 
10K+ subscribers
2011 will be our first 8 
figure year, and we 
maintain margins of 83%+ Howd We Do That? Up until 2010, SEOmoz had never spent money directly to acquire customers! (No PPC, no ads, 
just conferences and content production, aka sweat marketing)

Marketing Spend is Still Unbalanced vs. Behavior Organic Marketing is Under-Invested
Web Traffic is driven almost entirely by organic/earned media, yet nearly all of the investment in driving 
traffic to websites is through paid channels This is an unsustainable dichotomy.
Organic drives 
90%+ of traffic
(but garners only 
~$5 billion of 
investment in 2011) Paid drives 
<10% of web 
traffic
(but wins a whopping 
$31+ Billion of 
investment in 2011)
Percent of Web Traffic from Various Sources to the Average Website These challenges require scalable, high quality software to solve. Very few companies are investing in 
this space in a serious way, and almost none target the SMB market.
Its a Data-Driven World and Efficiency is King Problem(s) Were Here to Solve Organic Web Marketing is Poorly Understood
Even those marketers who have an understanding of the process often get lost in the details or mired 
in the complexity of tying creative to metrics.
Invest in Content, Search, 
Social, Local and/or 
Participatory Online Channels
Measure Traffic and 
ROI Effectively
Re-Invest in ROIPositive Channels
Earn Outsized 
Traffic/Branding/Customer 
Acquisition Rewards vs. Paid 
Marketing Channels The Web Marketers Weekly Analytics Challenge
Facebook Insights
Twitter (Topsy/Hootsuite)
Every week (sometimes daily), web marketers need to log in to 
each of these services (or a suitable substitute) to collect their KPIs:
FourSquare
Yelp
Google Analytics
Google Webmaster Tools
Bing Webmaster Tools
Google Alerts
Google Local
Many (75%+): Most (~50%): Some (~10%):
SEOmoz
Feedburner
PostRank
Why should a marketer log into 10+ sites/tools just to get the basic numbers they need to measure 
and improve their campaigns? Moz can (and should) put this all in one place.
Bit.ly
Yahoo! Site Explorer Specific, Painful Web Marketing Tasks
Each of these requires special tools, large amounts of manual labor 
or custom-built, in-house/agency solutions:
Researching New 
Opportunities
Identifying HighROI Channels
Prioritizing + 
Managing Tasks
Finding Errors + 
Problems
Optimizing 
Existing Channels
Training New 
Marketers 
These challenges require scalable, high quality software to solve. Very few companies are investing in 
this space in a serious way, and almost none target the SMB market. Our Target Market Today, Moz focuses on just the red SEO circles. In the future, many more of these will become 
customer targets. (BTW - I cheated by using two bubbles for SEO  sorry about that Venn Diagram 
purists!)
Moz has captured an 
estimated 5-10% of just 
these 2 circles to date We Help Marketers Who Focus on Organic

This presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on our managements current estimates, beliefs and assumptions, which are based on 
managements perception of historic trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Although we believe that the plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions and strategies reflected in these forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors 
that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although the 
forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, investors are cautioned against placing 
undue reliance on these statements since actual results may vary from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown 
risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect our results. These risks are described in 
further detail in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in our filings with regulatory agencies. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if 
our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. 
References to long-term trends in our model are forward-looking and made as of the current date. Nothing in this presentation should be regarded as a 
representation by any person that these long- term trends will be achieved and we undertake no duty to update its long-term trends. 
We believe that the case studies presented in this presentation provide a representative sample of how our merchants have been able to use various features of 
our platform to grow their respective businesses. References in this presentation to increased visits, growth and sales following implementation of our platform do 
not necessarily mean that our platform was the only factor contributing to such increases. 
To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP financial measures that 
exclude certain items. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other 
companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Twitter: @dakwak AngelList: angel.co/dakwak Waheed@dakwak.com www.dakwak.com The Problem
Launching and Managing Multilingual Websites:
As a result, startups, SMBs, and even enterprises 
are missing out on potential markets
In Fact
Costs a lot of time, money, and effort
Requires lots of technical development
Involves a sheer amount of logistics and 
coordination
Of Fortune 500 companies websites 
are not translated, including 66% of 
Fortune 500 retail companies
50%
Twitter: @dakwak AngelList: angel.co/dakwak Waheed@dakwak.com www.dakwak.com The Solution
We decided to make the process effortless and smooth, how?
The time to to give the chance of going globalto even the smallest of businesses
has come.
Live, SEO ready, multilingual website through a simple sign up form
No technical involvement; not a single line of code needs to be written by the user,
and no integration needed
Total control over translation quality; machine, users team, and professional
translation options available
Reduced human resources, time, and capital investment

 High potential for error 
 Owner must live near property

TIMELINE PILOT STUDY : UCSF
 Retrospective study  complex elbow fractures  60 observations
 Impact on: 
 Confidence in surgical planning (high)
 Hardware selection and fit (increased)
 Intra-operative time saving (projected at 20%)
 Quality of models (high)
Would change how Id approach; looking at this makes it more likely Id have 
recognized need for bone grafting
Improves confidence in treatment plan
Based on CT would have done CT and gone posterior; based on model would have 
gone anterior and used some absorbable fixation 
Complex intra-articular with a bad CT, [this] gives you more info on how it will fit 
together, relationships of fragments
Know what to look for for retractor positioning, incision location CUSTOMER 
VALIDATION
 What makes for a successful surgery?
 Having the expected outcome, having the surgery go as planned
 How do you think imaging can be improved?
 Challenges with 2D image conversion to real patient; current preop 
imaging gives me a sense, but different when Im in the OR
 What are some of the factors that lead to longer surgery 
time?
 Unclear anatomy is #1 Unexpected findings Surgery is different 
from what you expected
 Whats the biggest challenge with respect to pre-surgical 
planning?
 Time to review imaging in depth It is time intensive REGULATORY

in Any Visualization Tool in Minutes
We help marketers aggregate data without developers Too many advertisement platforms.
Marketers spend too much time preparing 
and combining reports from multiple platforms.
Report creation and analysis requires standardizing data from multiple platforms and manually 
uploading it into data visualization tools or spreadsheets.
With over 3,800 Martech platforms on the market, there is no solution to aggregate data 
and performance without a team of developers or manual ETL process
Problem Solution
Aggregate Advertising Data in Any Visualization Tool in Minutes
Save Time and Money: Free up development resources.
Marketers no longer have to depend on developers to create 
api integrations, maintain databases, or query data.
Cutting Edge Technology: It's nearly impossible to combine 
data from all Martech platforms without our technology. 
Two types of data exist in our market: 1) Log type of data and 
2) API data, and we've built a unique approach to accomodate both. 
Experienced Team: We are experts in MarTech with over 20 years 
of combined experience in Marketing within our core founding team. 
We've been in our customers shoes and understand how arduous 
the process is.

 We provide what customers really care about; data aggregated from all major Martech 
platforms so that each marketers can flexibily visualize their story. 
 Reporting platforms focus on selling their data visualization tools, and there are 1000s 
of visualization tools in the market. We realize it's nearly impossible to build the perfect 
visualization tool to meet each agency or brands unique needs, so we give them their data 
via 3rd party servers.
 We can combine log data and API data which most reporting platforms are not currently doing.
 MarTech Vertical Focus. All of the current ETL providers don't support most Martech platforms. 
Instead, they tend to be very broad in their focus for example CRM platforms, databases, 
payments, or emails. We are a customer driven

Testing was done with 3 small ecommerce businesses and 1 power 
seller in Rio de Janeiro over the 
course of 4 weeks
All revenues are real, but costs are 
stated on a pro forma as-if basis
- Shipping costs stated as if eSedex rates had been applied
- Pickup costs calculated on a perhour basis using market costs for

We tested it and it worked.

 Longer-term opportunity to create a full-service local logistics solution
 Great team with logistics, e-commerce and growth experience Appendix Manda is a collaborative consumption model that 
strips inefficiencies out of the system
Individuals & small businesses currently 
send stuff like this... ... but pooling shipments makes the system more efficient
Each sender must find/purchase their 
own packaging
Each takes their shipments to the post 
office (with each making round trips)
Optimized pickup routes to/from each sender & one 
pickup from carrier = reduced distance/time travelled
Pooling of shipments = increased shipping discounts
Volume purchases of packaging from wholesalers
Savings of time, resources and money across system Our market is NOT the same as the local-delivery 
market (couriers / motoboys)
Scheduling Motoboy industry
 Several motoboy scheduling apps have appeared and 
received funding within the last 6 months:
 Over 1.5 million motoboys throughout Brazil
 Over 500,000 in So Paulo (state) and 200,000 in 
So Paulo (city) alone
 So Paulo state market estimated to be R$2.2 billion
R$2 million from COO of Uber, Bolt 
Ventures and others
R$2 million from various angel 
investors
Others:
 The market we participate in is larger
 But the motoboy market is one we could enter in the future Unit economics calculation

Notes
 Assumes scenario of modestly higher volumes, which implies a 
degree of optimization. 
 Pickup fee stated on a weighted average basis; assumes 60% of 
pickups are 1-item pickups, 25% are 2 items, and the remainder split 
evenly between 3-, 4-, and 5-item pickups. 
 Packing & materials includes estimated labor costs of packaging the 
items plus packaging material costs. 
 Payment processing costs assume use of an optimized payment 
system, which includes a payment processor and credit card 
storage/repeat-billing service provider such as Cielo / CobreBem 
(based on their actual rates).
 Pickup costs are based on motoboy & fuel costs (NOT motoboy 
retail prices, which are over 2x costs). Also note that this calculation 
is on a per item basis: with our routing system, several items may 
be picked up at each stop, and each trip may include several 
stops. As we optimize the number of stops and items per route, 
pickup costs per item decrease substantially. Historical growth proxy of our customer segments

By making shipping easy, our vision is to 
help more people ship even more stuff
...which in turn accrues to Manda
This creates value for everybody...
More people and e-commerce stores 
can sell more stuff online, benefitting 
the broader economy
More shipment volume for Correios 
and other carriers, thereby increasing 
the size of the entire shipments pie 
Compelling solution creates a case for 
high adoption, usage and revenues

Projected Manda gross revenues Customer lifetime value calculations
Per segment LTV calculations
General assumptions
Note: See page on Market for details on Segmented Addressable Market for each customer segment. The assumptions used above fall
within general macro statistics or have been reasonably adjusted for customer type. E.g., average shipments by internet sellers is 7/year; 
we adjusted to 24 to account for greater power seller concentration. Average shipments per e-commerce store is 2,319; we used a 
significantly more conservative estimate of 120. We also used a more conservative average shipment cost estimate; average industry 
shipment spend per package is between R$30-R$50.
Revenue per shipment R$26
Contribution margin 40%
Inflation / price increases 6%
Discount rate 15% First-year monthly forecast Five-year projections Key modeling assumptions
 General pricing assumptions assume average shipping revenue / item of R$ 20 (with 6% annual 
inflation increases), plus a R$10 pickup fee for 1-item orders
 Customer segment assumptions:
- Individuals: 3 shipments / year, 75% utilization of Manda, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.1 items 
per pickup, R$ 32 in revenues per pickup. CPA of between R$ 2 and R$ 5.
- Online sellers: 24 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.8 
items per pickup, 1.1 visits per month, R$ 40 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.
- E-commerce: 120 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda, 50% annual attrition rate, 2.9 
items per pickup, 3.5 visits per month, R$ 58 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.
 Shipping costs conservatively calculated using standard contract pricing tables published by the 
Correios (Brazils postal service)
- Costs are based on published contract tables, not hypothetical volume discounts
- Costs decrease quickly with incremental volume increases
- Our aggregate shipping costs will vary depending on the shipment destinations. We used 
conservative assumptions, meaning we assumed unfavorable routes and discounts. We 
anticipate that in reality, well be able to realize higher cost-savings than whats assumed in our
